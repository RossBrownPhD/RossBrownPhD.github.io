I created an interesting visualization with a dataset I came across. After much data wrangling, I was able to develop this interactive visualization showing the age discepancies between male and female actors in couples depicted in Hollywood movies. I have many additional ideas to make this more informative, and I'll incorporat them in the future. Currently decades (1930 - Present) are color coded. Be sure to use the vertical and horizontal sliders, select chart areas to zoom, and hover for information. 
Here's the link:
