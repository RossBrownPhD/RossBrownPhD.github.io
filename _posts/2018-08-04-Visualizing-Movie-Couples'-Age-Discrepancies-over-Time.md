After much data wrangling, I was able to develop this interactive visualization showing the age discepancies between male and female actors in couples depicted in Hollywood movies (data source: https://hollywoodagegap.com/). Decades (1930 - Present) are color coded. Be sure to use the vertical and horizontal sliders, select chart areas to zoom, and hover for information.
