title: "Can winter severity predict admissions for alcoholism treatment?"
date: 2018-09-24
---

Research ties alcoholism to seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a depressive mood disorder associated with seasonal winter weather. I created a pilot study for a network of alcoholism treatment
centers to see if they could predict patient treatment demand -- and thereby manage staffing needs -- based on the severity of a given winter season, as measured by an index from the National
Weather Service.

The repository at the link below includes all materials for this project: Jupyter notebooks with Python code for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and machine learning; the full project report; the Powerpoint for the client; and a video of my presentation to the client. Please cut and paste the link if it doesnâ€™t work.
