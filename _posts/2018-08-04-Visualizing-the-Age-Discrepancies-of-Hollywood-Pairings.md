title: "Men Have it Better: Visualizing the Age Discrepancies of Hollywood Pairings"
date: 2018-08-04

I conceived of and created this fun interactive visualization showing how often and by how much men in movies are older than the women they are paired with. The length of each line reflects the age difference between actors in more than 900 movies, dating back to the 1930s. Decades are shown in different colors. Hover over a line to see the movie, the actors, their ages, and the age difference. Click and drag to zoom into an area of the plot. Scroll on the bottom or the left side to change the view. Double click to reset the view.    Multiple couples in a single movie are indicated with a number after the movie title. Can you find a movie where the age discrepancy was reversed, the woman was older than the man? Just how young are the women Woody Allen pairs himself with in movies. How many age-discrepant same-sex couples are depicted in movies? [Click through](https://bit.ly/Hollywood_age_differences) to explore the plot and find out (scroll to the bottom to see the ploty).
