title: "How can an Airbnb host maximize occupancy?"

A recent stay at an Airbnb rental with a newbie host prompted me to wonder, What can a host do to increase occupancy at his or her property? I set out to see if data science might provide the answer â€“ perhaps to the benefit of hapless hosts.

Using data from Airbnb, I sought to predict properties with 75% occupancy for 60 days in the future. For features I chose aspects of rentals that hosts have some control over.

This project includes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection and engineering, comparing the performance of seven machine learning models, and identifying the most important features.

Turns out there's a lot that hosts can do that is predictive of lower vacancy rates. Click the link below to read on and find out.
