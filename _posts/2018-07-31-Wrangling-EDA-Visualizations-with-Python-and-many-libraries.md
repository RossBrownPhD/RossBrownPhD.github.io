Here's a Jupyter notebook that includes python code, including several libraries, for data wrangling, feature engineering exploratory data analysis and the creation of several visualizations.

Github does not host Jupyter notebooks with interactive visuals, so Jupyter provides the hosting link above. I am not sure how long it is active. IF THE LINK ABOVE IS NOT ACTIVE, please navigate on github to the repository RossBrownPhD/Work_Samples_and_Resume (on my main github page). There you can click on the file (01_Visualizations), and at the top right of the notebook a theta symbol will link you to the nbviewer interactive version.
