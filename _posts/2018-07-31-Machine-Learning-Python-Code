This is the Jupyter notebook with Python code for a data science project. Github Pages doesn't work well with links so please cut and paste it:

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RossBrownPhD/Capstone_1_Final_-Submission/blob/master/A_Code/03_machine%20learning.ipynb

Github does not host Jupyter notebooks with interactive visuals, so Jupyter provides the hosting link above. I am not sure how long it is active. IF THE LINK ABOVE IS NOT ACTIVE, please navigate on github to the repository RossBrownPhD/Capstone_1_Final_-Submission/A_Code (on my main github page). There you can click on the file (03_machine learning.ipyn). You may have to paste the link to nbviewer to see visuals., and at the top right of the notebook a theta symbol will link you to the nbviewer interactive version.
