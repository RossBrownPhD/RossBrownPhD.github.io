I created an interesting visualization with a dataset I came across. After much data wrangling, I was able to develop this interactive visualization showing the age discepancies between male and female actors in couples depicted in Hollywood movies. I'll be fine-tuning this in the future.

Drag and select an area of the chart to zoom in. Slide your mouse across the bottom to change what time period is shown.
