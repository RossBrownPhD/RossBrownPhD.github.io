Natural Language Processing is a major tributary of data science. For this project I used NLP methods to create features derived from text to predict a categorical target. Specically, this NLP project entailed:

1. Preprocessing text so that it can be used for machine learning algorithms.
2. Two vector encoding approaches (word frequency and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract features from movie reviews for bag-of-words modeling for predicting fresh reviews.
3. Using several machine learning algorithms with both vector encoding approaches.

Rottentomatoes.com is a movie review aggregator that classifies positive movie reviews as "Fresh," and negative movie reviews as "Rotten." Along with this categorical designation, for many of the reviews the data includes snippets of the text movie reviews. These snippets are the natural language text (the features) that I used to predict whether the review is classified as Fresh or Rotten (the target).
