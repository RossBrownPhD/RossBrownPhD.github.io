title: "Dashboard: Drug abuse in America: Who, what, where and when?"
date: 2018-11-07

I conceptualized and executed multiple visualizations for this dashboard, diving deep into a data set I was familiar with from another project. Starting with detailed information on every American admitted for substance abuse treatment over a 23-year period, I focused on abuse patterns for common illegal drugs. In the process of extracting that data, I encountered missing data, tracked down the extent of the missing data and adjusted my plans to account for the omissions.

My exploratory data analysis on the 41 million records identified interesting patterns across time, race and gender that I chose to highlight in the dashboard. I also combined the data with census data to illustrate how different states vary in rates of abuse and preferred drugs.
