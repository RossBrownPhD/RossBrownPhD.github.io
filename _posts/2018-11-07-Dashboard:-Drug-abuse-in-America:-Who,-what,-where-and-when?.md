date: 2018-11-07

For this dashboard, I:

* wrangled data on every person admitted for substance abuse treatment in America over a 23-year period, extracting and analyzing 41 million cases out of more than 400 million;
* conducted EDA to identify interesting patterns in the data;
* and conceptualized the presentation, combined data sources and created interactive visualizations for the dashboard using Plotly.

Click through to play around with the visualizations and find the answers to the questions in the headline.

Repo with Jupyter notebooks to follow.
